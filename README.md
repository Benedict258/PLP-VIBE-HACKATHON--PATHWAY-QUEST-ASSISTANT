🎯 What Is Pathway Quest?
Pathway Quest is an interactive, all-in-one productivity platform designed to help individuals, accountability partners, and small teams stay organized, motivated, and purpose-focused.

—all within a sleek, modern UI.

Whether you're chasing personal goals, leading a team, or building habits, Pathway Quest helps you break them down, track them consistently, and stay motivated throughout your journey.

✨ Why I Built This
In a world of overwhelming task apps, most tools feel either:

❌ too rigid
❌ too complicated
❌ or just uninspiring

Pathway Quest was born out of the desire for:

✅ A visually engaging dashboard that brings you back every day

✅ A space for life goals, weekly tasks & collaboration to coexist

✅ A tool that feels encouraging, not draining

This isn’t just a to-do app. It’s your personal quest hub.
